### What I learned

Even with my experience in HTML & CSS, this project was a good reminder of the importence of semantic structure. At first, I used a div with buttons for social links, but I later refactored it into an unordered list of anchor tags. This approach is more accessible, improves SEO, and better reflects the content's purpose.

```html
<ul class="links">
  <li>
    <a href="" class="button">GitHub</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="" class="button">Frontend Mentor</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="" class="button">LinkedIn</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="" class="button">Twitter</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="" class="button">Instagram</a>
  </li>
</ul>
```

### Continued development

Going forward, I'd like to get better at writing semantic HTML and improve how I structure my CSS.
